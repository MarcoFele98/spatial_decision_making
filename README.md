Here is the replication of the neural model of "The geometry of decision-making in individuals and collectives" Vivek H. Sridhar, Liang Li, Dan Gorbonos, Máté Nagy, Bianca R. Schell, Timothy Sorochkin, Nir S. Gov and Iain D. Couzin https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1811964115

## Background

Collective decision-making occurs at various biological scales. Groups of individuals as well as collections of neurons within one individual integrate information to make decisions. In addition, the spatial aspect of decisions are often overloocked, but the geometry of the decision-making problem could be key to understand the mechanism underlying movement directions. 
This very cool paper proposes that a similar bifurcation emerges from the spatial nature of decision-making at mulitple biological scales, both groups of individuals and collection of neurons. Specifically, when the angular difference between attracting options exceeds a threshold, collectives average the possible directions, but once the angular difference exceeds the critical threshold, the group breaks symmetry and makes a consensus decision towards one of the options.
